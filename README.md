Access the demo here: https://theinteluserwhocould.github.io/MPPRetro-Demo/

All other files taken from www.multiplayerpiano.dev which is based off mpp-frontend-v1 which is open source, only thing I modified was CSS, CSS is open source

The other files are simply to make a demo

Use retro.css, not screen.css -- screen.css has been modified to work with Github pages
